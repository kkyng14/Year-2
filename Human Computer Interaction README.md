Human Computer Interaction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course will introduce students to human-computer interaction theories and design processes. 
The emphasis will be on applied user experience (UX) design. The course will present an iterative 
evaluation-centred UX lifecycle and will introduce a broader notion of user experience, including 
usability, usefulness, and emotional impact. The lifecycle should be viewed as template intended 
to be instantiated in many different ways to match the constraints of a particular development 
project. The UX lifecycle activities cover contextual inquiry and analysis, requirements extraction, 
design-informing models, design thinking, ideation, sketching, conceptual design, and formative 
evaluation.
