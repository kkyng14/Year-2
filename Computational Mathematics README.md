Computational Mathematics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course is a combination of linear algebra and numerical methods as preparation
for computer science student to apply mathematics knowledge in core knowledge of
computer science. The first part of this course is an introduction to linear algebra. The
topics that are covered in linear algebra are linear equations, linear combinations,
linear independence, linear transformation, and vector spaces. The second part of this
course cover numerical methods that can be used to solve non-linear equation, linear
systems, eigenvalue problems, interpolation, differentiation and integration. At the
end of the course, students should be able to apply mathematics knowledge to solve
mathematical problems. Implementation of engineering tools such as MATLAB and
Python, would enhance student to use simple programming technique for solving
mathematical problems.
